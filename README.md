<h5 align="center">A handy tool for Sha1 to KeyHash conversion and vice-versa.</h5>

<p align="center">This app is a helper app for all android developers out there. You can use this app to convert Sha1 to keyhash value (required for facebook login integration) also if you have a keyhash value
then you can extract the source Sha1 value from it. It shows the extracted value in the top textfield which you can copy by simply tapping it also print the values in logcat (under info level) .
One scenerio to use this app is when you publish an app on play store which have facebook login integrated stops working after publishing it because Play Store again sign your app with
different signature so keyhash for that signature is different than yours original signature. So now you just have to grab that new Sha1 key from play console and paste in this app and create new keyhash and add it to the Facebook console. Also you can always verify which keyhash is created from which signature.</p>
